Act as a Lead Systems Architect. We are building "RAPID ROLE" from the ground up based on the @RAPID_ROLE_SPECS.md file. 

**YOUR MISSION:**
Initialize the core Dashboard Architecture. Do not build a generic landing page; build a high-performance Web App interface.

**PHASE 1: THE SHELL**
1. Create a `layout.tsx` that implements a 3-column grid (Sidebar: 80px, Main: Flex, Activity: 300px).
2. The background must be a deep obsidian (#020202) with a fixed, subtle animated mesh gradient.
3. Implement a `TopNav` component featuring the "RAPID ROLE" logo in a futuristic font and a 'Glass' Wallet component showing a $0.00 balance.

**PHASE 2: THE "GLASS" SYSTEM**
1. Build a reusable `GlassPanel` component using Tailwind: `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/10 rounded-2xl`.
2. Apply a "Gold Glow" hover effect to this component.

**PHASE 3: THE TERMINAL FEED**
1. In the right column, initialize "The Ledger." 
2. It should look like a developer console. Mock some data showing: "[SYSTEM]: User_772 bet 0.5 ETH on Mines... [RESULT]: WIN (2.2x)".

**CONTEXT:**
Refer to the screenshots provided earlier for the "Xaxino" games, but upgrade every asset to the Cyber-Luxe aesthetic defined in the MD. Use Framer Motion for all entry animations.
